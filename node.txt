In Youtube - we can have Courses and attach Reviews to it.

Courses mean a series of lecture.

A site to help you discover courses and also mention if it's completely free or not.



This package will install:
	•	Node.js v8.11.1 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v5.6.0 to /usr/local/bin/npm

Post Install

$ node --version
$ npm --version

Install express-generator

$ sudo npm install -g express-generator

$ express --version


Install MongoDB - Later

Install Bootstrap - Later

Install Heroku  Done : ankurlkw@gmail.com / Galaxy01!


To create a new project:

cd /Users/ankursrivastava/Desktop/Tools/Node/loc8r

$ express --view=pug git

install dependencies : $ npm install

To run the application use:

$ DEBUG=loc8r:* npm start

Access at : http://localhost:3000/


We can install $ npm install -g nodemon
This detects changes and restart if needed.

Instead of typing node to start the application, you type nodemon.

GIT and GIT-HUB

Follow

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

If you get : fatal: remote origin already exists

then use

$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ppreyer/first_app.git


$ git init
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "First commit"

These three things together will create a local Git repository containing the entire codebase for the application. When we go to update the application later on, and we want to push some changes live, we’ll use the second two commands, with a different message, to update the repository.
Your local repository is now ready. It’s time to create the Heroku application.

This next step will create an application on Heroku as a remote Git repository of your local repository. All this is done with a single terminal command:

$ heroku create

After running this I got

Creating app... done, ⬢ morning-brook-12266
https://morning-brook-12266.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/morning-brook-12266.git

Next -> push the contents of your local repository into the heroku remote repository.

$ git push heroku master

Everything is now in place, and the application is live on the internet! You can see it by typing in the URL given to you in the confirmation, via your account on the Heroku website, or by using the following terminal command:

$ heroku open

A SIMPLE UPDATE PROCESS

Every time you want to push some new changes through, you just need three terminal commands:

$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Commit message here"
$ git push heroku master


Install MongoDB using homebrew : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

Installed in /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.6.4

to start use

$ sudo mongod

Start a mongo shell on the same host machine as the mongod. Use the --host command line option to specify the localhost address and port that the mongod listens on:

mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017

Later, to stop MongoDB, press Control+C in the terminal where the mongod instance is running.

Install Mongoose

$ npm install --save mongoose

mongoose v5.1.1

Open a new Shell and start mongodb. We have configured all DB settings in db.js where we perform shutdown as well when Node app ends.

To compile a schema to model in Mongoose we can run

$ mongoose.model('Location', locationSchema);

To start MongoDB SHELL use

$ mongo

When you’re in the shell new lines start with a >


Terminal Basics:

$pwd to find out where we are

--To Debug using Chrome

$node --inspect-brk debugging.js

Go to chrome and enter chrome://inspect/#devices : now go to node developer tools.

--GitHub adding new files
$git add .
$git commit -m "Add existing file"
$git push origin master

--If we hit HTTP request query limit then use the fix here : https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/questions/2956062

--Git
	To download git headover to git-scm.com
	I already have it.

	git init //to initialize a git repository
	git status // to check untracked files
	git commit -m "V1"

	Coming to github we first need an SSH key to connect securely. To check if an SSH key exists use:
	ls -al ~/.ssh   //here al is to list all files. If we see a file like id_rsa then we already have a key.
	To generate a key use:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'ankurlkw@gmail.com'
				b is for bytes. This creates id_rsa

	We next want to run ssh agent and add this key.
		eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
		ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa //This adds identity

	Copy the SSH key using pbcopy command and paste it in github.

	To check github connection use:
	ssh -T git@github.com

	Heroku
		Install tools from toolbelt.heroku.com
		$heroku login

		Add local SSH key to Heroku
		$heroku keys:add
		$heroku keys //prints keys. We can remove them if needed.
		$ssh -v git@heroku.com // to test connection

		To run the app in Heroku a couple of changes are needed.
			1. We have hardcoded the port in server.xml. We need to use an environ var.
				 Earlier we had
				 app.listen(3000, ()=>{
				   console.log('Server is up at port 3000');
				 });
				 Now
				 const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
				 app.listen(port, ()=>{
				   console.log('Server is up at port', port);
				 });
			2. We need to tell Heroku which file to use as the start file. This can be done in pakage.json
				"scripts": {
					"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
					"start":"node server.js"
				}

			We can start the app using:
			$npm start

Now once we push changes to github we can do
$heroku create //to	push changes to heroku git and also create an app.
$git push heroku master
$heroku open
